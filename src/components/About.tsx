        <p>My name is Felipe and I am a programming enthusiast since 2021, when I watched a free course on the internet which covered the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Immediately fell in love with web development. Nowadays, I enjoy building personal projects from scratch to the point where they are ready to be deployed, be they a website, an API or both. More than anything, I have always given (and will continue to give) preference to challenges that enable the growth of intellectual autonomy, which is proving to be increasingly important nowadays.</p>
        <p>I am currently studying how the tools I usually use in my projects work under the hood; for instance, how a Node.js framework is built and how to create my own. In fact, just as the physicist Richard Feynman once said - and what I believe to be true when learning anything -, <i>&quot;What I cannot create, I do not understand&quot;</i>. </p>
        <p>Besides that, I consider myself to be a very self-taught, hard-working person, with great dreams and a will to be an excellent professional. Thinking outside the box is what guides me while programming. Outside of coding, I enjoy going to the gym, reading and learning about economics, which often inspires my work.</p>
